### MySQL-Bamazon


## Discription 

In this activity, I creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I recently learned. This application is a command line based storefront that utilizes Node.js and MySQL database as well as the mysql npm and inquirer npm packages. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
